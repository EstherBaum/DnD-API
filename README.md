## Program

* First sorts through the first layer that contains a list of dictionaries containing the options to select as the keys and corresponding urls to follow for more information. The user is given a list of the keys to choose. Once the user types in their choice the corresponding URL is chosen and the json response is saved. 

* A similar process is followed for the next step, but the new dictionary is generated from information inside a nested dictionary. 

* The last step prints a description of the final option the user has chosen.
